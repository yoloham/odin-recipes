In this project....

1) I created a folder on my local machine called 'the_odin_project'
	- I 'cd-ed' into the folder.

2) I then created a new repo on GitHub called 'odin-recipes'

3) I moved (or cloned) the new repo onto my local machine using a git command on Terminal

4) I then cd-ed into the odin-recipes project directory on my Terminal

5) As I am typing this now for step 5, I this is the setup for README.md

Following on..

I will be creating a website which will reflect what I have learned so far on The Odin Project.

This website will be a simple page on Recipes.
